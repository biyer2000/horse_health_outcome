# horse_health_outcome
		
The goal of this project is to predict the health outcomes of horses based on various factors such as age, whether they had surgery, and their protein amount. The outcomes are whether the horse lived, died, or was euthanized. This project involved data analysis, visualization, data cleaning, and testing multiple models for predictions. The best model was the random forest classifier that gave 85% accuracy.
